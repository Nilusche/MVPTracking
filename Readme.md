Consists of 
- Data Pipelines to transfer data from Firebase to Elastic or generate fake data in Firebase
- Google Cloud Integration with services such as Cloud Run, Cloud Scheduler
- Terraform Integration to set up the entire required infrastructure in a few commands and one config file
- [Architecture Review Board](Firebase_Elastic_Integration_ARB.pdf) documenting architectural choices, implementation details, and business requirements discussing with stakeholders
